        This method calculates the reward received by the assigned robot for this particular goal.

        The float is the reward value, the first bool signifies if the goal has been successfully achieved
        and the last bool signals an env-wide terminal state. To illustrate:
        The position goal will return *some_number*, True, False if the robot EE is in the desired target position. The True is for reaching the goal,
        the False is because other goals might not have been reached yet and thus the episode cannot end yet.
        A collision goal might return *some_number*, False, True if the EE has collided with something. The False is for colliding, the True is for ending
        the episode, because after collision no other goal matters anymore and the episode has to be ended.
        Also, if self.normalize is True the reward here should be normalized.
